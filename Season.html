<h3> 2018 Season Schedule </h3>
<ul>
	<li> Falcons @ Eagles </li> This should be a tough game for game 1, but the Eagles can pull it off. W
	<li> Eagles @ Buccaneers </li> Eagles should win, as their offensive line should be able to hold down the Bucs. W
	<li> Colts @ Eagles </li> Easy win, Colts are arguably the worst team in the league. W
	<li> Eagles @ Titans </li> This could go either way, depends if Titan's QB Marcus Mariota has a good game or not. ?
	<li> Vikings @ Eagles </li> Eagles should win, Vikings have to come back to Philly and they won't be very happy about that. W
	<li> Eagles @ Giants </li> If anyone in the division will beat the Eagles this year, it's going to be the Giants. They should have at least one win against the Eagles. L.
	<li> Panthers @ Eagles </li> Tough game, and mobile QB Cam Newton might cause some problems for the Eagles D. L
	<li> Eagles @ Jaguars </li> Only issue I see with this game is that it's all the way in London. Eagles should be able to contain the Jag's offense. W
	<li> Cowboys @ Eagles </li> I could see the Eagles losing if they get caught off guard by the Cowboys offense. But the Eagles are still very likely to win. W
	<li> Eagles @ Saints </li> Saints QB Drew Brees could pick apart the Eagle's secondary, but some of our secondary have yet to be proven and could cause issues for Drew. ?
	<li> Giants @ Eagles </li> Eagles come back with a venegance to defeat the Giants in Philly. W
	<li> Redskins @ Eagles </li> Eagles sweep the Redskins, their defense is just too much for QB Alex Smith. W
	<li> Eagles @ Cowboys </li> Eagles beat the Cowboys again, this game matters for a playoff spot. W
	<li> Eagles @ Rams </li> Tough game, for first in the NFC. Rams win due to a couple broken plays. L
	<li> Texans @ Eagles </li> Another loss for the Eagles, Houston QB Deshaun Watson is too elusive for the Eagles D. L
	<li> Eagles @ Redskins </li> Eagles win to get #2 seed in the NFC playoffs. W
	<li> Final Verdict: W-10  L-4  ?-2    Best Record Prediction- 14-2      Worst Record Prediction- 9-7 </li>
	<li> Eagles likely to get to the NFC championship, will probably play either Rams or Vikings, Superbowl is a possibility </li>
