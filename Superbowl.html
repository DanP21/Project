The first Superbowl win by the Philadelphia Eagles was Superbowl 52 on February Fourth, 2018. They beat the New England Patriots 41-33 to get their first ever win. The win came off an "underdog" playoff run after losing their starting QB, Carson Wentz, with an ACL in the last games of the regular season. They had the #1 seed in the NFC playoffs, but still were underdogs to the #6 seed Atlanta Falcons. They beat the Falcons 15-10, and then were set to play the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC championship game. After the Vikings scoring on their opening drive, the Eagles scored 38 unanswered points to end the game at 38-7. This led up to the Eagles' underdog Superbowl win, defeating the Patriots dynasty with a backup QB.</p>
<p> The win can't be credited to everyone, but important players include QB Nick Foles, the RB trio of Legarrette Blount, Jay Ajayi, and Corey Clement, WR Alshon Jeffery, and the Linebackers stepping up to play when the defensive line were getting blocked. Most importantly, Head Coach Doug Pederson was important, because he called the plays, and General Manger Howie Roseman, who put the Superbowl winning team together.</p>
